$cli listname add tuple adds new lines
$cli listname complete tuple #moves to listname_completed
$cli summary #lists all to do lists
$cli move listname item, listname #moves item from one list to the other


$cli render settings
## allows to set: wrap length, truncation length, line prepend and append, how many lines to display, render to
$cli render listname -combined, -complete, -active, -separate

structurally we store each list as a folder with txt files
so we have:
listname:
  render-settings
  listname-active
  listname-completed

and then we render to a user selected file

lists we can marshall as line separated items, break on the line separation
